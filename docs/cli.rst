.. _cli:

Command Line Interface
======================

.. versionadded:: 0.1

The primary method of running **sdep** is through the command line interface. We use
`click <http://click.pocoo.org/>`_ to easily create a command line interface. It
is through the command line interface that we perform all of the actions
included in **sdep**.

Basic Usage
-----------

After installing **sdep**, you will find a :command:`sdep` script installed.
This script contains the :command:`create` and :command:`update` commands
necessary to deploy a static website from scratch and then update its contents
repeatedly.
